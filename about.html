                    <p>Our company has grown into one of the largest specialty coffee roasters in the Indonesia on the back bone of our reputation for the quality, freshness, and unmatched customer service.</p>

                    <p>We roast our coffees separately by origin and type.
                    <p>Full City roast, taking the coffee into the second crack, is our standard and most popular roast.
                    <p>We also roast Aceh, Ijen, Bali and Toraja each of which gets progressively darker. Light roast is available upon request
                    <p>When blending, we combine the beans after they've cooled in a large mixer and spin them to ensure the different varieties and in many cases different roast profiles get fully integrated.
                    <p>Similar to the approach a fine wine maker uses when blending, we want to make sure each component is contributing distinctive and desirable characteristics to the blend. 
                    <p>We specialize in helping our customers develop and maintain exclusive blend recipes that distinguish their coffee shops and restaurants from the competition. </p>
